# Pasta Multi-Scalar Multiplication

This is an initial version with a list of planned improvements:

- ~~parallelize~~;
- break down scalars to signed digits to half the buckets' integration complexity;
- switch to alternative bucket point representation with faster addition formula;
- migrate CUDA implementation;
